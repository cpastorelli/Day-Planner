# Day Planner

## About this Project

![Day-Planner](./assets/images/dayplanner-top.png)


This project was a lot of fun but also slow going for me. I was stuck on how to recreate sections in jQuery, however when reviewing the classes I was able to understand a bit better and get the practice in. 
This project was to get into the practice of understanding moment.js and jQuery and be able to navigate through the files if I were to go in and see the code. Overall a lot of fun to test out and play around with!
